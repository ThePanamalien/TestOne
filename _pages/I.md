### **ISO 19110:** 
International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Feature Catalogue 19110:2005.  
ISO 19110 defines the methodology for cataloguing feature types. 
It may be used as a basis for defining the universe of discourse being modelled in a particular application,
or to standardize general aspects of real-world features being modelled in more than one application.

ADIwg mdJSON and mdEditor use this standard to describe tabular datasets in ISO metadata records. 
It is not a perfect fit, but it is all that is available for data descriptions in ISO metadata. 

___

### **ISO 19115-1:**
Defines the schema required for describing geographic information and services by means of metadata. 
It provides information about the identification, the extent, the quality, the spatial and temporal aspects, 
the content, the spatial reference, the portrayal, distribution, and other properties of digital geographic 
data and services. (International Organization for Standardization (2014). ISO 19115-1:2014.

### **ISO 19115-2:**
International Standards Organization Geographic Information - Metadata 19115-2:2009 Extends the existing geographic 
metadata standard by defining the schema required for describing imagery and gridded data. 
It provides information about the properties of the measuring equipment used to acquire the data, the geometry of 
the measuring process employed by the equipment, and the production process used to digitize the raw data. 
This extension deals with metadata needed to describe the derivation of geographic information from raw data, 
including the properties of the measuring system, and the numerical methods and computational procedures used 
in the derivation. The metadata required to address coverage data in general is addressed sufficiently in the 
general part of ISO 19115. (International Organization for Standardization (2009). ISO 19115-2:2009.
